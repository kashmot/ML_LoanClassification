# ML_LoanClassification
ML2 Individual Project using SMOTE and neural networks

Executive Summary

This study explored how to handle imbalanced datasets using SMOTE (best performing resampler) and MLPClassifier (highest precision) for neural networks. The business value of using precision as the metric was initially explored but F1 scores were also evaluated. MLPClassifier has limitations (only 3 choices of activation function) and we can look at numpy implementation for more flexibility. A keras implementation was also explored as an extra in this study.
